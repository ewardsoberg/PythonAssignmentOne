1.	Explain what a variable is -

A Python variable is a label name for a reserved memory location that stores data values.
Every value has a datatype. Unlike many other programming languages where you declare a variable to have a specific
data type and it must always have that data type, variables in Python can be assigned one data type and later re-assigned
to a different.

2.	Explain what a function is -

The definition of a function in the mathematics is - 'an expression, rule,
or law that defines a relationship between one variable (the independent variable)
and another variable (the dependent variable)'

In programming, a function is a block of code that contains the instructions to create an output
based on its input. A function can be used over and over again. When a call to the function is made,
the program stop executing the code on the current section and starts execute the first line inside the function.

3.	Explain what a program is -

A program is a specific set of ordered instructions for a computer to perform a task.
A program can be categorized as an interactive program, which requires user interaction to operate
or a batch program, that just runs, does what it is created for and then stops.

4.	Explain what makes a program effective -

* Good user experience - It needs to be easy to use and give the user a pleasure experience to interact with.
* Good availability - It needs to be ready to run functions etc. when needed.
* Good performance - It needs to perform in certain speed to meet different requirements.
* Easy scalability - Be able to easy change in size, both increase and decrease.
* Easy adaptability - Be able to easy change in functionality.
* Good security - Have good security, to prevent attacks and ensure integrity.
* Good economy - Be cost efficient to build, change and maintain without compromising the quality of the program.


5.	Explain what effective programming is -

* Use coding standards - It will make it easier for other developers to adapt to your code.
* Quality, not quantity - Good quality code is harder to write but easier to maintain in the long run.
* Write useful comments - Makes the code easier to read and understand for you and other developers.
* Refactor your code - Multiple lines of code can often be split up to several functions for more availability.
* Use naming conventions - Use describing names and use naming conventions such as camelCase, snake_case etc.
* Use version control software - Such as GIT, to keep track of modifications and be able to turn back to previous
version if a mistake is made och error occur.
* Testing/Bugfix - Use testing tools and debugger often. The cost of fixing bugs grows exponentially over time.
